/**
 * A simple class used to harvest a compressed hexadecimal ASCII data file 
 * from a Brooke Ocean Seahorse profiler equipped with a Seacat SBE19plus CTD. 
 * Communication is over a TCP socket connection with an Iridium satellite modem
 * and a serial2ip converter host. The data samples are then converted into RBNB
 * frames and pushed into the RBNB DataTurbine real time server.  This class  
 * extends org.nees.rbnb.RBNBSource, which in turn extends org.nees.rbnb.RBNBBase, 
 * and therefore follows the API conventions found in the org.nees.rbnb code.  
 *
 * The parsing of the data stream relies on the premise that each sample (scan) 
 * of data is a Hex-encoded string of values, and that each sample is terminated
 * by a newline character (\n).  It is also assumed that the sample rate is 4Hz,
 * or a sample is taken every 15 seconds.
