# This example connects to the RBNB server via its WebDAV interface and
# requests the BinaryADCPChannel data channel from the KN0101_010ADCP010R00
# source instrument, using a start reference of the oldest record in the ring
# buffer, and requests a duration of 3 units of data (which equates to 3
# seconds).  The result is sent to STDOUT and piped to hexdump, which decodes
# the binary stream into zero-padded, twobyte, uppercase hex numbers, and on
# every 514th iteration, inserts a double line ending (since the test data
# streams ensembles that are 514 bytes long.
